    "text": "The electricity, heating, and transport sectors in urban areas all have to contribute to meeting stringent climate targets. Cities will face a transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources, with electricity acting as a cross-sectorial energy carrier. Consequently, the electricity demand of cities is expected to rise, in a situation that will be exacerbated by ongoing urbanisation and city growth. As alternative to an expansion of the connection capacity to the national grid, local measures can be considered within city planning in order to utilize decentralised electricity generation, synergies between the heating and electricity sectors, and flexibility through energy storage technologies. This work proposes an optimisation model that interconnects the electricity, heat, and transport sectors in cities. We analyse the investments in and operation of an urban energy system, using the City of Gothenburg as an example. We find that the availability of electricity from local solar PV together with thermal storage technologies increase the value of using power-to-heat technologies, such as heat pumps. High biomass prices together with strict climate targets enhance the importance of electricity in the district heating sector. A detailed understanding of the integration of local low-carbon energy technologies can give urban planners and other city stakeholders the opportunity to take an active role in the city's energy transition.",

      "text": "The development and planning of cities in the 21 st century face a number of challenges.Concomitant with managing continuous growth and urbanisation [1], cities must implement policies to meet climate targets and mitigate carbon emissions [2].Energy planning in cities has to include and integrate efficiently the different sectors for electricity, mobility, heating and cooling, into what is often called \"smart cities\" [3,4].Increased electrification is seen as one corner-stone of this development.New electricity loads, together with an increased population density, are likely to increase the annual and peak electricity demands of cities.As a consequence, several cities have identified an urgent need to increase the connection capacity from the national electricity grid.Investments in new capacity are often associated with long lead-times.An alternative, which is the focus of the present work, is to increase reliance on local electricity and heat generation, in combination with the utilisation of flexibility by storage technologies. Sectorial couplings and electrification have, on larger geographical scales, been identified as important components of a fossil-free energy system [5,6].How such couplings play out on a limited urban scale remains to be analysed in detail.The different parts of city energy systems are represented in the literature by, for example, the integration of a large share of renewables into the urban energy system [7][8][9][10], the integration of electric vehicle charging [11][12][13], the operation of urban district heating in the modelling.Section 5 presents the conclusions drawn and reflections as to further developments to the proposed model.",

In the model, the hourly electricity load profile can be met by a combination of electricity that is imported from the national electricity grid to the city, electricity that is generated within the city borders and electricity that is discharged from an electricity storage.The amount of electricity that can be imported is limited by the import capacity.To focus the analysis on the effect of local generation and storage technologies on system design and operation, no export from the city energy system to the national grid is considered in the current version of the model.The hourly district heating demand cannot be met by heat delivered from outside of the city but has to rely on local heat production within the urban district heating system or the heat discharged from thermal storage units. The electricity and district heating demand profiles are used as inputs to the model, together with a systems [14][15][16][17], and sector-overlapping analyses [18][19][20][21].Previous studies have provided valuable insights into low-carbon scenarios in different parts of the city energy system.The present work adds to this body of knowledge by including options for investments and dispatch of technology in relation to both the electricity and heating systems, as part of the techno-economic optimisation modelling.We model future, zero CO 2 -emission energy systems in growing cities, with the focus on the interconnections between the electricity and heating sectors, while considering a fixed limit on hourly electricity import from the national grid. This paper presents and applies a linear urban energy system optimisation model and analyses: • The potential role of local energy balancing, i.e. local electricity and heat generation, together with electricity and thermal storage technologies; and • Investments in and the composition of urban electricity and district heating systems, directed towards meeting stringent CO 2 emission targets.The model is applied using the city of Gothenburg as a case study.Similar to other cities, for example Copenhagen [22], the city of Gothenburg has formulated strategies to reduce its climate impact, by aiming to e.g.phase out fossil fuels in the district heating system, produce 500 GWh of renewable electricity and reduce CO 2 emissions from road transport by 80% as compared to 2010, all by 2030 [23]. The paper is organised as follows.Section 2 describes the flexibility potential of sectorial coupling in an urban energy system and the method developed.Section 3 gives the results from the modelling of an example city.Section 4 presents a discussion of the assumptions made",

The modelling includes the following technology options: • Electricity generation: Solar PV technologies, peak power gas turbines fired by natural gas or biogas.and the common assumptions made to represent its future development, i.e., assumptions that remain the same in all the modelled cases.Thus, in the modelled cases Gothenburg is assumed to have increased electricity and heat demand by a factor of 1.5.Yet, in the model the connection capacity from the national grid to the city is limited to present day levels.This means that in modelled future cases the connection capacity limit corresponds to 55% of the maximum winter electricity load; and that there is sufficient connection capacity to cover all load by imported electricity during about 4 000 hours per year.In short, we model increasing demand in a city that is assumed to grow in size and population, however, without any possibility of new investments in connection capacity to the national grid.With these assumptions, we investigate the roles of local generation and flexibility in the city energy system. For the case study of the city of Gothenburg we investigate two base modelling cases and three additional modelling cases in a sensitivity analysis.The cases differ in terms of the cost assumptions for biomass (and biogas), PV, and batteries, as presented in Table 2.The Low Cost Bio case is intended to reflect the cost assumptions for a near-term future, while the Low Cost PV case should represent a longer-term future, with greater competition for biomass.The trajectories of the PV and battery investment costs and biomass prices are uncertain.To specify units.The synergies between electric vehicle charging and discharging and the city electricity and heating sectors will be investigated in a future study.",

      "text": "In this work, a simplified growth factor of 1.5 for both the electricity and heat sectors in the city energy system has been applied to all the cases modelled.Yet, the development of future electricity and heating loads is highly uncertain.Energy efficiency measures on the electricity or heating side, the implementation of demand-side management and the utilisation of the building shell for thermal storage could influence the shapes of the demand profiles for electricity and heating.Considering any of the above measures in the analysis could flatten some of the demand peaks and thereby reduce the utilization of batteries and tank storage units, as compared to the results presented in this work.The magnitude of demand growth in the city's electricity and heating sectors over the upcoming decades depends largely on how the city continues to grow.New construction projects in cities often include low-energy buildings.At the same time, new, large-scale consumers (such as those arising from the electrification of industrial or manufacturing sites) could emerge. The availability of sustainably harvested biomass in future scenarios and the assumed costs for this fuel are highly uncertain.Larger competition for biomass can be expected in future energy systems, raising the question the summer months.We have also found that CHP generation is reduced during hours of low electricity prices when more electricity is imported into the city and heat pumps and electric boilers are used to provide heat.The possibility to utilise thermal pit storage to supply heat during periods of highest heat demand can be assumed to dampen HOB investment and generation in this modelled case. Figure 4 shows the dispatch of the different technologies for the Low Cost PV case.The biggest differences in relation to the Low Cost Bio case are the much larger investments in solar PV (due to the lower PV investment costs), as well as the investment in additional thermal storage capacity.The excess electricity from PV is stored either in batteries or as heat, mostly in long term pit storage.Thus, thermal pit storage with heat pumps is utilised as seasonal storage, as shown in Figure 4, whereby the storage level is at its lowest in the middle of April and peaks during September.It is also evident that biomass CHP is utilised to a lesser extent, especially during the summer months when CHP is not in operation.The large PV capacity, together with electricity imports and storage options are sufficient to supply the summer electricity load.The utilisation of heat pumps in the Low Cost PV case is more related to the PV generation profile than to the electricity price.It should be kept in mind that in the cases modelled, export of excess electricity from local generation in the city is not possible.Thus, heat pumps, especially during summer, are run to make use of PV-generated electricity, supply the heat load, and charge the thermal storage.Moreover, as a consequence of the high level of generation from PV, there are many more hours without electricity imports (especially in the day-time) in the Low Cost PV case, as compared to the Low Cost Bio case.",

The sectoral integration in the city energy system involves the collaboration of a number of actors and stakeholders that traditionally did not develop common strategies.One aspect that can facilitate installation and operation of local energy technologies are local prices for electricity and heat.In a city where electricity import capacity is at its limits (as with the assumptions in the case study modelled) there should be an increased value of local generation of electricity to the urban energy system.If this value is also seen by local actors, through e.g.local prices or local markets for energy, an incentive is created for local energy generation and storage.Another option to foster a common organization of the city energy transition is the formulation of energy and climate goals and regulations imposed on urban actors to meet these.With an increased interest of private actors, like household customers, in owning small-scale generation and storage units parts of the investment in local technologies could be driven by small-scale actors.The EU's \"The clean energy for all Europeans package\" [25] enables active energy citizens and communities to be part of energy markets and thereby support the energy transition.",
