# SciLake Energy Pilot ‚Äì GeoTagging Scientific Publications

This repository provides examples and workflows for **geotagging scientific publications** in the context of the **Energy Planning Pilot** of the [SciLake European Project](https://www.scilake.eu/).  

The repository demonstrates how to extract and normalize **geographical information** from scientific publications using two main components:

- [**AffilGood**](https://github.com/sirisacademic/affilgood/tree/main/docs)  
  Identifies and geolocates geographical components of **affiliations** extracted from publications.  
  üìÑ Paper: [*AffilGood: Building reliable institution name disambiguation tools to improve scientific literature analysis* (ACL 2024)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.sdp-1.13/)

- [**GEORDIE**](https://github.com/sirisacademic/geordie/tree/dev)  
  Extracts **geographical mentions** in text (title, abstract, full text), normalizes them, and characterizes them by semantic role.  
  üìÑ Paper: under development

## ‚ú® Goal

To build a reproducible pipeline that:
1. Uses **[GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid)** to extract structured metadata and fulltext (affiliations, title, abstract, body).  
2. Applies **AffilGood** to process author affiliations and obtain geotagged institution locations.  
3. Applies **GEORDIE** to detect and normalize geographical mentions across the publication text.  
4. Produces enriched publication data for **energy planning research** in the SciLake pilot.

## üî¨ Context
This work supports the Energy Planning pilot of the SciLake project by enabling:
* Mapping of research contributions to geographical contexts
* Supporting knowledge graphs with spatial dimensions
* Facilitating regional and cross-country energy analysis

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Process publications with GROBID
Extract structured metadata and full text:
```bash
# Example: process a batch of PDFs with GROBID
```

### 2. Run AffilGood
```bash
# Example: process a batch of publications
```

### 3. Run GEORDIE
```bash
# Example: process a batch of publications
```

### 4. Combine results and output postprocessing
- case study fixing / grouping / section processing
